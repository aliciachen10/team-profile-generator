# Team Profile Generator



# Description
The team profile generator utilizes a command-line prompt interface to log information about individual employees. It creates a card for each individual employee and populates it with different information based upon whether that employee is a manager, engineer, or intern. This application was built with Javascript and showcases usage of the Inquirer package (for prompts), object oriented programming (for creating employee, manager, intern, and engineer classes), and Jest (for testing).
